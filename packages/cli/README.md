# @roam-research/roam-cli

Command-line interface for [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/).

Used for setup (connecting graphs, managing tokens) and direct tool access (search, get pages, create blocks, etc.).

> **Alpha Software**: This project is in early development and subject to breaking changes.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Full Write Access**: The CLI can create, modify, and delete pages and blocks in your Roam graph. **Changes may be difficult or impossible to undo.** Roam does not have a traditional undo history that can reverse bulk operations or deletions made through the API.
>
> **Recommendations:**
> - Back up your graph before use
> - Start with a test graph
> - Be specific in your commands to avoid unintended changes

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or later
- **Roam Research desktop app** (the local API is not available in the web version)

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @roam-research/roam-cli
```

## Setup

```bash
roam connect
```

This walks you through selecting a graph, choosing permissions, and approving the token in the Roam desktop app.

**Non-interactive** (for scripts and LLM agents):

```bash
roam connect --graph my-graph-name --nickname "My Team Graph" --access-level full
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--graph <name>` | — | Graph name (enables non-interactive mode) |
| `--nickname <name>` | Required with `--graph` | Short name you'll use to refer to this graph |
| `--access-level <level>` | `full` | `full`, `read-append`, or `read-only` |
| `--public` | — | Public graph (read-only, hosted) |
| `--type <type>` | `hosted` | `hosted` or `offline` |

To remove a connection:

```bash
roam connect --remove --graph my-graph-name
```

## Usage

```bash
roam list-graphs
roam connect                                                    # Interactive setup
roam connect --graph <name> --nickname <name>                   # Non-interactive
roam search --query "my notes" --graph <name-or-nickname>
roam get-page --title "My Page" --graph <name-or-nickname>
```

If you only have one graph configured, the `--graph` flag is optional.

Run `roam --help` to see all available commands.

## Multiple Graphs

Run `connect` multiple times to add additional graphs. Each graph gets a nickname (a short name like "work" or "team acme") for easy selection.

- **Single graph configured**: Auto-selected, no action needed
- **Multiple graphs configured**: Pass `--graph <name-or-nickname>` on each command

## Available Tools

All tools are available as CLI commands. Run `roam <command> --help` for details on any command.

**Graph Management:**
- `list-graphs` - List all configured graphs with their nicknames
- `setup-new-graph` - Set up a new graph connection, or list available graphs

**Graph Guidelines:**
- `get-graph-guidelines` - Returns user-defined instructions and preferences for AI agents

Graph guidelines let you store preferences and context directly in your Roam graph that AI agents will follow. Create a page called `[[roam/agent guidelines]]` with your instructions.

**Content:**
- `create-page` - Create page with markdown content
- `update-page` - Update page title or children view type
- `delete-page` - Delete a page
- `create-block` - Add markdown content under a parent
- `update-block` - Update block content/properties
- `move-block` - Move a block to a new location
- `delete-block` - Delete a block

**Read:**
- `search` - Search pages/blocks
- `search-templates` - Search Roam templates by name
- `roam-query` - Execute a Roam query (`{{query:}}` blocks, not Datalog)
- `get-page` - Get page content as markdown
- `get-block` - Get block content as markdown
- `get-backlinks` - Get references to a page/block

**Navigation:**
- `get-open-windows` - Main window view and all sidebar windows
- `get-selection` - Currently focused block and multi-selected blocks
- `open-main-window` - Navigate to page/block
- `open-sidebar` - Open in right sidebar

**Files:**
- `file-get` - Fetch a file hosted on Roam (handles decryption for encrypted graphs)
- `file-upload` - Upload a file to Roam (from local path, URL, or base64)
- `file-delete` - Delete a file hosted on Roam

## Updating

To update to the latest version:

```bash
npm install -g @roam-research/roam-cli
```

Check your current version with `roam --version`.

## Using with npx

If you prefer not to install globally, you can use npx:

```bash
npx @roam-research/roam-cli connect
npx @roam-research/roam-cli search --query "my notes"
```

Reading:
  roam gp -t "Page Title"                   Get page as markdown
  roam gp -u UID                            Get page by UID
  roam gp -u UID -d 2                       Get page, limit depth
  roam gb -u UID                            Get block as markdown
  roam bl -t "Page Title"                   Get backlinks for a page
  roam bl -u UID -l 50                      Get backlinks with limit
  roam bl -u UID -r edited-date -R asc      Sort backlinks
  roam bl -u UID -f "search term"           Filter backlinks
  roam gg                                   Get graph guidelines
  roam win                                  Get open windows
  roam sel                                  Get current selection

  Pages and blocks return markdown with <roam> metadata tags
  containing UIDs for follow-up operations.

Searching:
  roam s -q "search term"                   Search pages and blocks
  roam s -q "term" -s pages -l 10           Search page titles only
  roam s -q "term" -s blocks                Search block content only
  roam s -q "term" -i false                 Search without paths
  roam st -q "template name"                Search templates
  roam q --query "{and: [[TODO]]}"          Run a Roam query
  roam q -u UID                             Run existing query block

  Search returns paginated results. Use -o (offset) and -l (limit)
  to page through them.

Writing:
  roam cp -t "New Page"                     Create empty page
  roam cp -t "Page" -m "# Content"          Create page with content
  roam cp -t "Page" -v numbered             Create page with view type
  roam cb -p PARENT_UID -m "Block text"     Create block
  roam cb -p UID -m "- item 1\n- item 2"   Create nested blocks
  roam cb -p UID -m "Text" -O first         Create block at top
  roam up -u UID -t "New Title"             Rename page
  roam up -u UID -v numbered                Change page view type
  roam up -u UID -t "Existing" -M           Merge into existing page
  roam ub -u UID -S "New text"              Update block content
  roam ub -u UID -H 1                       Set heading level (0-3)
  roam ub -u UID -v bullet                  Change block view type
  roam ub -u UID -a center                  Set text alignment
  roam ub -u UID -e false                   Collapse block

  roam dp -u UID                            Delete page
  roam mb -u UID -p NEW_PARENT -O first     Move block

  Markdown content supports nested lists. Use '- ' prefix with
  indentation to create block hierarchies in a single call.

Navigation:
  roam go -u UID                            Open in main window
  roam go -t "Page Title"                   Open page by title
  roam side -u UID                          Open in sidebar
  roam side -u UID -T mentions              Open mentions view

Files:
  roam fg -U URL                            Download file
  roam fu -F ./image.png                    Upload local file
  roam fu -U https://example.com/img.png    Upload from URL
  roam fd -U URL                            Delete file

  Upload returns a Firebase URL. Create a block with ![](url)
  to embed the image in your graph.
